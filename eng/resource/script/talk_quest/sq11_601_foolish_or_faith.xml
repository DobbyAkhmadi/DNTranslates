      <qdesc>칼라엔은 돈히코테가 잃어버린 시간의 폐허에 나타났다면서 그곳에서 뭘하는지를 알아오라고 한다. 잃어버린 시간의 폐허 보스방에 가면 돈히코테가 있다. 위습 자이언트를 물리치고 말을 걸면, 돈히코테는 자신이 정령들의 여왕을 구하러 왔다가 공격을 당했다고 한다.
그는 위습 자이언트를 정령들의 여왕이라고 믿고 있고, 그녀가 저주에 걸려서 이성을 잃었다고 단언하고 있다. 그는 새로운 계시를 받았다면서 로터스 마쉬로 떠나겠다고 한다.
칼라엔은 돈히코테의 이야기를 비웃다가, 유저가 그를 옹호하면 위습들이 정령들의 변형체일지도 모른다는 이야기를 한다.</qdesc>

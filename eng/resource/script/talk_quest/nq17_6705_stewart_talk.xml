Sometimes those who are in fear do something unexpected. Foolish people can't be helpful at all.</html>]]></talk_question>

Even if we govern well, they don't obey us. Getting balance is very difficult. I want His Majesty to be wise enough to know this.</html>]]></talk_question>

Whoever got the power can destroy and conquer. However there is more important things in governance than just power.</html>]]></talk_question>

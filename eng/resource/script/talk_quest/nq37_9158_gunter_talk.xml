Geraint had a feeling that he does not live in the same world as us. I thought he was a cold person. However, he wasn't if someone needed help because he was always the first one to lend a helping hand. </html>]]></talk_question>

I'd be lying if I said no. Everyone was wondering why he'd left. The Black Dragon had been brought down but we had lots of work to do. We needed the leader but he wasn't around at that time. </html>]]></talk_question>

Yeah. I couldn't understand why he would leave just like that. I may know if I wasn't left behind during Black Dragon Raid. </html>]]></talk_question>

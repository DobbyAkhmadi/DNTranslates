      <talk_question mid="28"><![CDATA[<html>$Merca Captain Hector$<BR>Right. We created a smaller prototype and tested it at the sea, but the deck was too low. It was around the same level as the sea so long trips were impossible.</html>]]></talk_question>

We thought the help of one or two mages would be enough, but they had to use magic constantly.

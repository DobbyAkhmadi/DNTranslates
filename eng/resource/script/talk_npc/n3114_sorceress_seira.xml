I heard that Sidel Fairystar is helping us track down the unknown source of the cold energy. Nests from the past are being revived in a frozen state. The Silver Dragon is sealing away these Nests using the Silver Dragon's Forcefield. I'm a pupil of Kallaen who was secretly dispatched to help with this endeavor.</html>]]></talk_question>

         <talk_question mid="12"><![CDATA[<html>$Sorceress Seira$<BR>
Sidel Fairystar is investigating the Nests based on the suspicion that an extra-dimensional magical power is the underlying cause. We Sorceresses have been dispatched to look for clues to accessing these Nests. I was ordered to share the clues with you, if you want. Of course, as an order from Kallaen, this information won't come for free.</html>]]></talk_question>
